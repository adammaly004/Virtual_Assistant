# Virtual Assistant
My virtual assistant is called Pikachu. Pikachu is a computer assistant written with Python 3.9.1 to help you find your favorite apps and sites.
I made two versions, Pikachu and Speak_Pikachu. Speak _Pikachu can speak and listen :-).

This project was created after 3 months of learning Python, so I apologize if the code is not well optimized in some parts. I didn't come up with any problem, if you find something, I'll be glad if you advise me.

## Setup & Installtion
Ensure you have python 3.9+ installed.

You need to replace "your_path" in commands.json with your file/program/website path!

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
```
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the App
```
python assistant.pyw
```

```
python assistant_speak.pyw
```

There is sometimes a problem with installing PyAudio. If the pip doesn't work for you, here is the answer:

You can fully set all commands in commands.json

Have a nice day and enjoy Pikachu!
